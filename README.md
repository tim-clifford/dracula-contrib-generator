# Dracula Contribution Generator

Saves me a bunch of time and hopefully lowers the barrier to entry for
contributors :)

## Usage

You will need github-cli to use this, then just run `mkdracula.sh` from any
\*nix shell. You will be prompted for information about what you're making the
theme for, but after that all you'll need to do is add the files, a screenshot,
and the installation instructions in `INSTALL.md`, then open an
issue at [dracula-theme](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme)!
